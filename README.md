# Schip8 (not the SuperChip)

An emulator for the famous chip8.

To compile the program you need the SDL2 library

The makefile is just a boilerplate (couldn't be bothered to re-write one)

Compiled fine with:
- Windows 11 x64, Ryzen 5 3600, 16Gb of RAM
- SDL 2.26.4
- GCC 13.2.0 with MSYS2
- Make 4.4.1
