# Schip8 (not the super chip)

A emulator and disassembler for the famous chip8 (the disassembler is completely garbage).

To compile the program you need the SDL2 library (any latest version should work ; in case my version is 2.26.4)

The makefile is just a boilerplate (couldn't be bothered to re-write one)

To use the emulator/disassembler : prgName.exe rom.ch8
